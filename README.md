App Goals
I made an Event Planning App to help people keep track of events like parties, meetings, and appointments. The goal was to make it easy for users to add, see, and get reminders about their events. This app was made to help users stay organized without getting confused.

Screens and Features
The app has a login screen so people can make an account and sign in. It has a main page that shows all the events in a grid. There is also a screen where users can add new events, and the app sends reminders when an event is coming up. I made sure the buttons were big, the text was easy to read, and everything was simple to find. This helped make sure users could move around the app easily without getting lost.

Coding Process
When I built the app, I worked on one part at a time. First, I set up the database, then the login page, then the event grid, and finally the reminders. I made sure to write notes in my code to explain what everything did. Working step-by-step helped me stay organized and made the project less stressful.

Testing the App
I tested the app by running it after I finished each part. I checked if logging in worked, if events could be added, and if the reminders popped up. Testing was important because it helped me find small mistakes early, like missing a permission or spelling something wrong.

Challenges and Solutions
One hard part was getting the app to send reminder messages. I had to learn how to ask the phone for permission to send messages. After a lot of testing, I finally figured it out. Solving this problem made the app better and safer for users.

Proud Moment
I am really proud of the event grid that shows all the events. I showed that I know how to connect to a database, organize information, and make it easy for users to find what they need.
